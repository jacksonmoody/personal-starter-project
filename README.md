# Personal Starter Project

This is a starter project for quickly developing web applications built with Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI. It was inspired by the [Next.js + Supabase Template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/supabase).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacksonmoody/personal-starter-project.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd personal-starter-project
npm install
```

3. Set up Supabase:

- Create a Supabase project and obtain the Supabase URL and Anonymous Key.
- Create a `.env` file and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to the credentials from Supabase.

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.
